# Blackjack

Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a classic card game renowned for its blend of strategy and luck. Players strive to outscore the dealer without surpassing 21. The game's simplicity and suspense, combined with its strategic depth, make blackjack a beloved favorite among players of all skill levels.

By building the game with Code Institute's Python Template, it offers the flexibility to run online rather than solely on a CLI or Command Line Interface.

## How to play

To play blackjack, each player is dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer receives one card face-up and one face-down. The goal is to get a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Players can choose to "hit" to receive another card, "stand" to keep their current hand. The game blends luck and strategy, as players must decide when to take risks and when to play it safe.
